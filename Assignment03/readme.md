# MySQL Transaction Isolation Levels ‚Äì Practical Assignment

## üéØ Objective

Demonstrate how different MySQL transaction isolation levels affect data consistency and concurrency. Focus on identifying and explaining transactional anomalies such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and deadlocks.

---

## üß™ Tasks

### Task 1: Dirty Read (READ UNCOMMITTED)

- Create a scenario using two concurrent sessions where one session reads data modified but not yet committed by another session.
- Use the `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level.
- Record the output of both sessions.
- Explain why the anomaly observed is considered a **dirty read**.

**Points: 5**

---

### Task 2: Non-Repeatable Read (READ COMMITTED)

- Create a scenario where a transaction reads the same row twice but gets different results within the same transaction.
- Use the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level.
- Record the session output that demonstrates this behavior.
- Explain the concept of **non-repeatable read** using the observed results.

**Points: 5**

---

### Task 3: Explanation and Terminology

- For each of the above tasks, provide a brief written explanation using correct transaction terminology:
  - What caused the observed anomaly?
  - Why does the isolation level used permit it?
- Ensure that terms like "dirty read", "commit", "transaction", "concurrency" are used correctly.

**Points: 5**

## üîÅ Bonus Tasks

### Bonus Task 1: Repeatable Read (REPEATABLE READ)

- Design a scenario to demonstrate that once a transaction reads a row, any committed updates to that row by other transactions are not visible until the transaction ends.
- Use the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level.
- Include the output and explanation.

**Bonus: +1 Point**

---

### Bonus Task 2: Non-Repeatable Read vs Repeatable Read

- Compare results of the same update scenario under `READ COMMITTED` and `REPEATABLE READ`.
- Clearly distinguish the behavior of each level in your explanation.

**Bonus: +1 Point**

---

### Bonus Task 3: Deadlock

- Create a scenario involving two sessions that leads to a deadlock.
- Describe the steps taken and how MySQL responded.
- Capture and include any MySQL error or diagnostic output related to the deadlock.
- Explain why the deadlock occurred and how it was resolved.

**Bonus: +1 Point**
