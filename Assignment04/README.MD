# Practical assignment 4

## The purpose of this task

Learn how to develop an operational database for a specific business application, understand the importance of data modeling, and apply optimization techniques for performance at scale.

You can work alone or in teams of up to 3 people. If working in a team, a joint presentation is required.

## Requirements

### Basic requirements (_for 15 points_):

| # | Requirement                                                                                   | Points |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1 | Build your own **operational database** for a business use case of your choice                | 2      |
| 2 | Use **entity relationships** (1:1, 1\:many, many\:many) appropriately                         | 2      |
| 3 | Implement **constraints**: `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`, etc.                 | 2      |
| 4 | Use **indexes** for optimization (insert \~500,000 rows into at least one or more key tables) | 3      |
| 5 | Add **comments** on tables and their columns for documentation                                | 1      |
| 6 | Present an **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**                                              | 2      |
| 7 | Explain your solution using correct **database terminology**                                  | 2      |
| 8 | Demonstrate **good business understanding** of the domain and data                            | 2      |

## üß† Business Understanding Requirements (2 points)
Choose a business (e.g., e-commerce, hospital, logistics, education, etc.) and explain:

What problem the business is solving

What data entities are critical for its operation and why
Example: In an e-commerce platform, Orders, Customers, and Products are critical entities. You should be able to explain what KPIs this data supports (e.g., top-selling products, customer lifetime value).

### Additional points (_for 3 points_):
| # | Task                                                            | Points |
| - | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1 | Create at least **3 different users** with different privileges | +1     |
| 2 | Create at least **1 view**                                      | +1     |
| 3 | Create a **stored procedure**                                   | +0.5   |
| 4 | Create a **trigger or function**                                | +0.5   |

Meeting the basic requirements of Practical Assignment 4 allows for a maximum of 15 points to be earned, and completing additional tasks listed under the heading "Additional points" can yield up to 3 extra points.
