# üìò SQL Practical Assignment

## üéØ Objective

This assignment is designed to assess your practical SQL skills. You will be required to:

- Create a set of tables.
- Populate these tables with sample data.
- Write a set of SQL queries using various SQL concepts.

## ‚úÖ Basic Requirements (Total: 15 points)

1. **Create 5 tables**  

2. **Insert sample data**  
   Populate each table with at least 5‚Äì10 rows of realistic data.

3. **Write the SQL query that will include**:

   - ‚úÖ A `SELECT` query joining **5 tables**.
   - ‚úÖ A query using a `WHERE` clause.
   - ‚úÖ A query using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
   - ‚úÖ A query using `ORDER BY`.
   - ‚úÖ A query using `LIMIT`.

4. **Total for basic functionality: 15 points**
